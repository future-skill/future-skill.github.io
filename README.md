# Future Skill wiki
This is the public repository for Future Skill's wiki.
The main purpose for the wiki is to act as a development resource when making new exercises/challenges/tournaments/freecodes for [futureskill.com](https://futureskill.com).

The wiki is based on [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), please refer to that page for documentation of the wiki framework.
In a nutshell, each wiki page is a markdown document with some additional functionality, check [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for more in-depth information.

All python dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.
You can install them easily with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, and then run a preview server for the wiki with the command `mkdocs serve`.
