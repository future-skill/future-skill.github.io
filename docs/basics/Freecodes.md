In Freecodes, the programmer is free to do whatever they want to do.
Since there is not a specific problem to be solved, a Freecode is not rewarded with any achievements or experience points.

Example of freecodes could be a graphics demo, a utility for generating pictures, or to do some kind of simulation.
The sky is the limit!


## Create your own Freecodes!

On Future skill it is possible to create your own Freecodes!
This is done with the freecode creator that you can access from the create option.
