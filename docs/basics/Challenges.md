In a Challenge, a competitor can create a solution for a specific problem that will then be evaluated and added to a highscore ladder where community members can compete against each other for the top position.
Submitting a solution and achieving impressive highscores are rewarded with *achievements* and *experience* points.

When a solution to a challenge is evaluated it will run against some hidden levels.
These hidden levels typically run against a larger data set compared to the public levels that the competitor got to test their code against whilst writing their solution.


## Tournaments

In a standard challenge you are only competing against a static opponent.
However there is a special version of challenges called tournaments where you can compete against your friends and other developers from around the world.
