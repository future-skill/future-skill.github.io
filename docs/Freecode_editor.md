The Freecode Editor is the tool used to create solutions to [Challenges](Challenges.md), [Exercises](Exercises.md), and [Freecodes](Freecodes.md).

The Editor consists of four main sections as seen in the image below.
On the top left side is a description of the current activity, and below it there is usually some graphical output using a canvas element.
On the top right side is the solution section where the programmer writes their solution code, and below it there is a console and score section where the output from running the solution code is shown.

The Editor supports a number of programming languages.
While programmers are free to choose which language to write their solution code in, it is encouraged to try different ones. In fact, solving a task in multiple languages is usually rewarded with achievements and experience points.

## Create your own implementations

The Editor is very similar to the Freecode Creator which you can read more about here: [Freecode creator](Freecode_creator.md)
