In the Future Skill Coding Community, there are several types of activities that members can take part in to practice and improve their coding skills.
The following sections describe the **Exercise**, **Challenge**, **Tournament** and **Freecode** activities.
It is also possible to create your own implementations for others, as described at the bottom of this page.
But first, the coding **Editor** should be introduced.


## The Editor

When performing one of the activities mentioned above, the Future Skill coding Editor is used.
The Editor consists of four main sections as seen in the image below.
On the top left side is a description of the current activity, and below it there is usually some graphical output using a [canvas element](Canvas_element.md).
On the top right side is the solution section where the programmer writes their solution code, and below it there is a console and score section where the output from running the solution code is shown.

The Editor supports a number of programming languages.
While programmers are free to choose which language to write their solution code in, it is encouraged to try different ones.
In fact, solving a task in multiple languages is usually rewarded with *achievements* and *experience* points.

## Exercise

An Exercise is usually aimed at introducing programming concepts or to solve for fun and to challenge yourself.
Exercises have *levels* and in order to complete an exercise, all levels must be solved.
Completing an exercise is often rewarded with *achievements* and *experience* points.

Read more about Exercises [here](Exercises.md).


## Challenge

In a Challenge, a competitor can create a solution for a specific problem that will then be evaluated and added to a highscore ladder where community members can compete against each other for the top position.
Submitting a solution and achieving impressive highscores are rewarded with *achievements* and *experience* points.

Read more about Challenges [here](Challenges.md).


## Tournament

Tournament is a special version of a Challenge.
In Tournaments, a submitted solution is run against solutions from several different programmers.
Each night, a tournament takes place where code from participating programmers compete with others in multiple matches.
When the tournament is finished, each solution receives an ELO-rating and an updated placement in the highscore ladder.

## Freecode

In Freecodes, the programmer is free to do whatever she or he wants to do.
Since there is not a specific problem to be solved, a Freecode is not rewarded with any *achievements* or *experience* points.

Read more about Freecodes [here](Freecodes.md).


## Create your own Challenges and Exercises!

On Future Skill it is possible to create your own Challenges, Exercises, and Freecodes!
This is done with the Freecode creator that you can access from the create option.
